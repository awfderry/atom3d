## ATOM3D: Tasks on Molecules in Three Dimensions

ATOM3D is a unified collection of datasets concerning the three-dimensional structure of biomolecules, including proteins, small molecules, and nucleic acids. These datasets are specifically designed to provide a benchmark for machine learning methods which operate on 3D molecular structure, and represent a variety of important structural, functional, and engineering tasks. All datasets are provided in a standardized format along with corresponding processing code and dataloaders for common machine learning frameworks (PyTorch and TensorFlow). ATOM3D is designed to be a living database, where datasets are updated and tasks are added as the field progresses.

Current datasets include:
  - Small Molecule Properties (SMP) [[download]](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1Uce6a6VoN9gYAn3V4eR3QC0f6a6mOXpI)

  - Protein Structure Ranking (PSR) [[download]](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1-Hn2f60BC4aJYGKLCeL_gebXVQYF6ZGS)
  - RNA Structure Ranking (RSR) [[download]](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1imQiQI6kyDnA4t-rxju0PetgJsASkx7S)
  
These datasets can be roughly grouped into four categories that represent a wide range of problems, spanning single molecular structures and interactions between biomolecules as well as molecular functional and design/engineering tasks.
